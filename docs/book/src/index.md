Froql is a proc_macro based DSL for dealing with graph-like state in Rust.
It allows an user to input data, define relations between data objects and then
query the data back out in whatever shape is needed at the usage site.

If you are familiar with ECS you might want to jump straight to the [Queries](./queries.md)
chapter to see what froql is all about.
Froql isn't *really* an ECS because it lacks systems but a lot of concepts overlap.

Otherwise skim the book from front to back, experiment and come back when you need to know something.
